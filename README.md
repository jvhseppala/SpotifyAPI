# SpotifyAPI
A SpotifyAPI script

Business case: Enable more granular targeting in advertising campaigns based on musical genres of the upcoming performer. The target segments are created by using internal Artist id:s as a list for either CRM lookup or URL matching.

Objective: Find similar artists, if available, based on previous events records. Provide similar music events to potential customers where a genre or genres of the upcoming event match those of previous performances.

Results: Improved performance in open rates and engagement in general; no A/B testing to conclude increase in sales lift
